# Module 5 |  Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Overview of Project
### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis was to establish the amount of retiring employees by position title.  In addition, we wanted to figure out the amount of employees who are eligible for a mentorship program to help prepare for retirements.

## Results

 - *Staggering amount of retirements*
 To touch on the main point of this analysis, a staggering amount of employees will soon be retiring.  Preparations are definitely needed.
 - *Senior staff exodus*

As might be expected, most of the retirements are coming from senior staff and engineer.  Transitioning these high level positions is definitely important.
 - *Mentorship program is good but more needs to be done*
Either the mentorship program needs to be expanded or there needs to be a strong hiring campaign.
 - *Employee repetition in database*
 As part of the analysis, we found many employees appeared twice in the database, perhaps as they were promoted.  Keeping better track of these repetitions may be helpful for future analysis.

## Summary
-   *How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?*
As touched on earlier, 72458 roles will need to be filled  as employees start to retire.
-   *Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?*
The amount eligible for the mentorship program stands at 1549, which pales in comparison to the amount soon to retire.  More must be done.

In addition
1. Recent Hiring is small.  In the last 3 years of hiring, only 12,351 employees were hired.
